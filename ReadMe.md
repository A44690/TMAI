# TrackMania Nations Forever AI

This projects aim to design and implement a gym environnement running in real time on the game TrackMania Nations Forever, using TMInterface. The objective will then be to implement a bunch on different classic RL methods on this environnement.

# Game screen image analysis
I use MSS to quickly take screenshots of the game window and then use a lot of post-processing using OpenCV to clean up the image to only keep the track borders.


# Current Objectives
-[x] Finish implementing arrow keys input simulation
-[] Implement Gamepad input simulation
-[] Run TMInterface in separate thread to get data from the game more efficiently
